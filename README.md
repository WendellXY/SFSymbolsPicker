## Changelog

### 1.0.2

The way the package loads SF symbols has radically changed. Now the symbols are read at run-time directly by the system, so the users can access the latest symbols added by Apple as soon as they update their devices. Special thanks to [mackoj](https://github.com/mackoj) for the suggestion in implementing this solution.

## Usage

Here's a short usage example. You can find the full code in [UsageExample.swift](https://github.com/alessiorubicini/SFSymbolsPickerForSwiftUI/blob/master/Sources/SFSymbolsPicker/UsageExample.swift).

```swift
@State private var icon = "star.fill"
@State private var isPresented = false
    
var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        VStack {
            Button("Select a symbol") {
                isPresented.toggle()
            }

            Image(systemName: icon).font(.title3)

                .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented, content: {
                    SymbolsPicker(selection: $icon, title: "Pick a symbol", autoDismiss: true)
                }).padding()

        }
        .navigationTitle("SF Symbols Picker")
    }
}
```

With custom button:

```swift
...

    .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented, content: {
        SymbolsPicker(selection: $icon, title: "Pick a symbol", autoDismiss: true) {
            // Your custom view...
            // For example:
            Text("Close!")
        }
    }).padding()
...
```
